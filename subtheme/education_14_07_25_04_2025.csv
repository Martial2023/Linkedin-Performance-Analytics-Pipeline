And even more concerning—how General Langley could go so far as to label Captain Ibrahim Traoré a threat to his people because, allegedly, he’s using the country’s mining resources for “personal protection.”Wait—are we talking about the same Captain Traoré who:✅ Declared free education from nursery to university for all Burkinabè ✅ Is actively investing in agriculture and economic recovery ✅ Is reclaiming territorial control from terrorist groups and working to secure his country's bordersBurkinabè citizens have shielded their president from over 19 assassination attempts. That doesn't sound like a population in distress—it sounds like a people standing with their leader.So, here’s my question: Why does Africa’s business suddenly matter to Western powers... when they’ve shown minimal interest in the continent’s stability unless resources or control are involved?Historically, Africa has minded its own business. I’m beginning to think that has been our greatest crime as people living on earth. We don’t invade. We don’t interfere. We don’t convene commissions to micromanage foreign nations. Africans have mostly just wanted to thrive on their land, raise their families, tend their farms, drink their beer and live in peace.If Africa is now building defenses and manufacturing or buying weapons, it’s not out of aggression—it’s out of necessity. Burkina Faso is simply trying to survive. Like any sovereign nation, it deserves the right to protect its people and its resources.And let me be crystal clear: We do not need another ""Libya"" situation. Remember how “help” looked in 2011? Libya was promised freedom. Instead, they got chaos, instability, and a broken state. That should never be repeated.Dear America, please:  🛑 Stop weaponizing concern. 🛑 Stop interfering where you’re not invited. 🛑 Focus on your borders, your people, your economy, your “Great again”.Burkina Faso’s people are not asking for rescue. If they ever do, it’s safe to say Western intervention isn’t the first place they’ll turn to. And rightfully so.By the way, If anyone in the comments can name one U.S. intervention in Africa that led to sustainable peace or prosperity—please, do share.

Across boardrooms, campuses, and policy halls, change is afoot - not always loud, but absolutely real!At Acumen, Part of Sannam S4 Group, we are seeing these shifts through student choices, partner priorities, and on-the-ground actions across geographies. We are not just observing but we are investing in these trends, helping universities future-proof their strategy and footprint.Here are 10 silent shifts that are already shaping the next chapter of global higher education:1. Students care more about jobs than rankingsPrestige is being replaced by practical outcomes. Students are asking: Will this lead to a job I want? Institutions must adapt faster.2. Micro-campuses are the new global playThinking mega-builds? Agile, local micro-campuses offer faster ROI, flexibility, and responsiveness.3. The “third country” student is the new normBorn in one country, schooled in another, and studying in a third! Student mobility is complex. Systems must evolve to support them.4. Enrollment strategy > recruitment targetsThe focus is shifting from getting students in to helping them thrive! Retention, outcomes, and support now define success.5. The Big Four are no longer the only destinationsStudents are choosing emerging hubs like Germany, UAE, Japan, Korea, and India! All this is driven by better visas, career routes, and local relevance.6. Sustainability is a deciding factorToday’s students care deeply about values. Green campuses and climate-conscious curricula now influence enrollment more than we think.7. Reverse TNE is on the riseWestern universities are sending students to Asia and the Middle East for credit-earning immersions, strengthening bilateral ties.8. School-university pipelines are being reinventedK12 partnerships are evolving beyond recruitment! Co-developing curriculum and preparing students more intentionally for higher ed.9. Regional autonomy is unlocking growthOne-size-fits-all is out! Empowered local teams are enabling faster decisions and more relevant strategies in high-growth regions.10. Higher ed as a tool of soft powerEducation is emerging as a powerful diplomatic channel. Student mobility and partnerships now influence global relations.These aren't just trends; they are realities already in motion. And the institutions that move early will shape what comes next.At Acumen, we are embedding these insights into our partnerships, policy engagements, and operations every day.

En une carrière de 39 ans mon seul passage en lycée aura été l'année de stage. J'ai eu beau demander un lycée de 1990 à 2001 puis en 2018 à mon retour, je n'ai jamais obtenu satisfaction, même depuis ma réussite à l'agrégation externe en 1996. J'avais contacté mon IA-IPR qui m'avait dit ne rien pouvoir y faire, qu'il me fallait attendre d'avoir ""assez de points"".Le système de mutation des profs est très mal conçu. Ce fut frustrant d'avoir atteint le niveau de préparation d'une thèse de géographie, d'être agrégé 12e/50, et de devoir rester en collège. J'ai heureusement pu enseigner de 1997 à 2004 à l'université en Facultés de Géographie et de Géologie, comme vacataire. Mais n'ai jamais terminé ma thèse car ce rythme m'a épuisé. Mes secondes carrières hors enseignement pendant 18 ans furent les plus belles années de ma carrière. En 2018 j'avais envie de démissionner mais après 55 ans dans le privé c'est très difficile de retrouver un emploi.De 2018 à 2024 j'ai donc subi des classes chargées, beaucoup d'élèves indisciplinés, des cas problématiques. J'ai pu vérifier que l'éducation nationale n'a pas (plus ?) les moyens d'endiguer la violence scolaire, que le règlement intérieur d'un établissement n'est plus adapté aux excès des élèves actuels, que le soutien apporté aux enseignants mis en difficulté par leurs élèves ou leurs parents reste symbolique.J'ai fait cette nouvelle expérience de l'enseignement car je savais que je pouvais l'écourter à tout moment.En effet, de 2016 à 2023 me furent proposés plusieurs postes de hashtag#cadre en administration intéressants, que j'ai tous refusés pour conserver ma liberté d'expression associative, car la contrepartie eut été de cesser AIDE AUX PROFS.Une contrepartie impensable. Après 55 ans le métier de hashtag#professeur devient éprouvant. Être toujours énergique et en bonne santé face à des élèves dont l'âge reste le même aux niveaux enseignés, est un défi quotidien. Moralité : oui, le métier d'hashtag#enseignant est usant, épuisant après 55 ans. Je l'ai vécu. La génération qui a dû obtenir le hashtag#Master2 devra travailler jusqu'à ses 65 à 70 ans pour obtenir ""le taux plein de pension"" et ce sera terrible pour eux.Vieillir dans ce métier est un véritable défi, les politiques publiques n'en parlent jamais, et les politiciens continuent d'allonger les carrières.Il y a là tout un chantier de réflexion à mener.",2025-04-25 11:46:57,7,2,1,education

My early education was in Hindi. I had a love for numbers and a quiet determination to do something meaningful with my life.That determination led me to Kolkata in the mid-80s, where I pursued Chartered Accountancy. The language was new to me and the environment was unfamiliar. But my commitment was strong.At 22, I cleared my CA exams and started my practice.For nearly a decade, I built my firm from scratch — one client, one referral, one timely delivery at a time. It was honest work. It gave me success and stability.It also gave me something else — perspective.In the late 90s, I set up a small data entry unit to support my CA firm. I hired fresh commerce graduates and trained them to handle real accounting work. I noticed something unusual: within a few months, many of them were getting better offers. Not because they had degrees,  but because they had gathered the skills.At the same time, I would meet hundreds of young graduates struggling to find jobs. And employers constantly complaining that “good people are hard to find.”The problem was not a lack of talent. It was a lack of preparation.That was my turning point.In 1999, I took a decision most found difficult to understand — I gave up my CA practice and started ICA Edu Skills's first training centre. No business model. No roadmap. Just a strong belief: that if we could train people the right way, we could change their lives.The journey that started with one classroom has now reached over 120 centres.And along the way, whenever we identified a gap, we built a solution for it. When we saw students struggling to get digital and content roles despite degrees, we started IDCM - Institute of Digital & Content Marketing — a dedicated training initiative for digital marketing. That’s always been my way of working. Quietly. Systematically. With a simple belief: if you can see a problem clearly, you can fix it — if you’re willing to build for the long term.And that same belief has led me to this next chapter — bringing India’s talent, systems and execution capabilities to the global stage. Especially for CPA firms who need partners they can trust, not just outsource to.The country has the talent. We have the infrastructure. Now, we’re ready to serve the world — the same way we’ve served India.hashtag#CA hashtag#ICA hashtag#CAPractice hashtag#Journey hashtag#Entrepeneurship hashtag#CAinIndia hashtag#Leadership hashtag#CPA",2025-04-25 12:46:57,86,14,0,education

Instead, remain calm, take deep breaths, and maintain a safe distance from the other vehicle. If necessary, slow down or change lanes to remove yourself from the conflict. Never exit your vehicle or respond with anger, as this can escalate tensions. If you feel threatened, drive to a populated area or contact authorities for assistance.

Abdul Malik shared this unique life journey of his in the BBC program Outlook.About his village, he tells that it may be a small and ordinary village, but its biggest feature is the tradition of education here. Education has been given importance here for generations and this is the reason why many teachers reside in this small village.When Abdul Malik was asked why he chose the path of becoming a teacher, his answer was, ""Becoming a teacher not only makes us better citizens ourselves, but also gives an opportunity to show the right direction to others. Education is the medium that makes us an ideal for children.""The school Malik goes to teach is in a village across the Kadalundi river. If he goes by road, the distance to the school is about seven kilometers, while by river the distance is just one kilometer. This village is surrounded by the river on three sides and there is neither a doctor nor any other teacher here.

To the funders, it was an easy sell: “Invest in this child, she’ll be the first in her family to graduate.” The theory behind this pitch seemed sound. In practice, the reality was more complex.Three years later, only 30% of my cohort earned their qualification. A significant portion didn’t even make it past the first year. So, what happened? Were these students ungrateful? Were they not taking advantage of the opportunities given to them? And what didn’t we get right?The truth is, there were many layers to this situation. Yes, the students needed the scholarship, but they also needed far more than just academic support. They needed psychosocial support.Many of us were uprooted from our homes, some from child-headed households, leaving behind siblings who depended on us. Part of the allowance we received was sent back home to help our families. I distinctly remember one of my peers, who was constantly distracted by thoughts of a sick sibling back home, despite being in class.These were the realities of where we came from.Years later, I’m heartened to see that the conversation around education has evolved. What started as a question of “How many students can we fund with X amount of money?” has shifted to “What would be the real impact of investing in this program?” or ""How best can we support these students?""It’s a welcomed mindset shift that recognizes the deeper, multifaceted support children need to truly succeed.Investing in education is no longer just about funding a seat in a classroom.

Last night as a Director for the Street & Glastonbury Chamber of Commerce I had the pleasure to attend a chat with the wonderful Rebecca Cumbo. She’s a young woman who started as a trainee at Numatic International and is now leading their socials. She proved her expertise confidently challenging ideas and creating a social presence for no other than our very British Henry! So far her work has reached over 6 million people across platforms. You may not know who’s Numatic International but I’m sure you have a Henry the Hoover around! She explained their journey through success and failure. We laughed and got creative discussing what collabs would be fun for Henry. They have recently created a limited edition of Henry x Oreo OREO, Distribuidores de Galletas OREO, Kraft Foods y Mondelez en Guatemala PBX 25093600 which is incredibly clever. Their other real collab was with Heathrow Express. I loved how they are open to create, to explore and to collaborate. Our creative minds got to play a little and I suggested a fun collab with the LEGO Group and LEGO Education Qazvin can you imagine a little Henry made of Lego?!! I can! My ChatGPT did a mock up for you. You are welcome. The next one thinking of shape was McDonald's with a Henry x Big Mac! Which is your favourite??? Which collab would you suggest?! Let’s get creative this Friday and end the week with a little fun! Thank you Rebecca Cumbo for a lovely evening learning from you personally and on behalf of the Street & Glastonbury Chamber of Commerce It is truly wonderful to see local mighty powerful companies available to support and engage with other local businesses. We learned a lot of what Numatic International does for our community and we are looking forwards to arranging a visit and learning even more!In the pictures 📸 you see 1- the real Henry x Oreo collab (pic from their instagram) 2- my ChatGPT collab idea Henry x LEGO 3- my ChatGPT collab idea Henry x Big Mac And don’t forget to follow their social at @myhenryuk Just please promise if you get to work with the LEGO Group that I’m getting one?!",2025-04-25 10:46:57,13,13,1,education

32,Reliance Industries Limited,https://www.linkedin.com/company/reliance/posts,"Media Release - “This is a very special game — you can be the inspiration for thousands of children.” – Mrs. Nita M. Ambani urges MI players ahead of ESA Day~ Mumbai Indians to celebrate hashtag#ESADay on April 27 at the Wankhede with 19,000 kids ~Mumbai, 25th April 2025: Mumbai Indians’ game against Lucknow Super Giants, scheduled for Sunday, 27th April at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, will be dedicated to the Education and Sports for All (ESA) initiative championed by Mrs. Nita M. Ambani. The annual ESA game is one of the biggest highlights of the IPL season every year for the Mumbai Indians, with thousands of spirited children from NGOs across the city lighting up the stadium with their infectious energy and dreams.Ahead of the upcoming ESA game, speaking to the Mumbai Indians team, Mrs. Nita M. Ambani said, “People who have been with Mumbai Indians know our next game is very special, we have underprivileged children coming, and the energy is really special. So please, put up your best show for them. They wait for years in line to get to come and see one match.”She also recalled a moving experience from a past ESA Day: “I was sitting in the stands with all of them, and this girl wasn’t eating much. She was picking on her food. I asked her why, and she said, ‘I’m saving it for my brother, because he’s never tasted cake in his life.’ These are the things that we want to support.  We want to inspire these kids, that in spite of coming from different backgrounds, you can achieve wonders.”Urging the players to make the day extra special, she added: “This is a very special game for me and for all of you who have been a part of this for many years. You can be the inspiration for these children and show them that they can be whatever they dream to be.”ESA, a flagship initiative of Reliance Foundation (the CSR arm of Reliance Industries Limited) in collaboration with Mumbai Indians, was launched in 2010 with the vision of making education and sports accessible to children from all backgrounds. Each year, MI’s one IPL match is designated as the ESA game, bringing to life the initiative’s mission to empower young minds, inspire ambition, and instill the joy of sports and learning.About ESA: https://lnkd.in/gnDeQggzHere are some glimpses of Mrs. Ambani in the stands with the kids from last year: https://lnkd.in/eP69hjpTHere is the link of Mrs. Ambani talking about ESA Day to the players:https://lnkd.in/eRJ6gHrtFollow Mumbai Indians on:Website – https://lnkd.in/guuhGApA Instagram – https://lnkd.in/gCykYy-7 YouTube – https://lnkd.in/gNj2kUza",2025-04-25 11:46:57,79,4,1,education

I had the pleasure of exploring the rich heritage of the creative city of Hanoi, admiring its historic monuments and vibrant traditional crafts.In my meetings with officials and diplomats, we addressed some of the most pressing issues of our time—chief among them, our shared commitment to peace. We discussed how to better prepare learners for a rapidly changing world, how to protect cultural heritage, and how to ensure that knowledge and technology serve the well-being of all.I leave Vietnam deeply energized by the richness of our exchanges and the warmth of the welcome I received. This visit reaffirmed my conviction in a UNESCO that listens more, connects more, and acts with boldness to build lasting peace through the power of education, science, culture, and communication.-زيارتي إلى فيتنام كانت حقا ملهمة، خاصة وأن الزيارة جاءت خلال فترة رمزية يتطلع فيها الشعب الفيتنامي للاحتفال بمرور خمسين عامًا على إعادة توحيد البلاد، في 30 أبريل. استمتعت بالتعرف على التراث الغني لمدينة هانوي، وأعجبت بمعالمها التاريخية، والحرف التقليدية الغاية في الجمال٠ خلال الزيارة، شرفت بعقد سلسلة من اللقاءات مع المسؤولين والدبلوماسيين، حيث ناقشنا بعضًا من أكثر القضايا إلحاحًا في عصرنا، حيث جاء على رأس تلك المناقشات أهمية إعادة التأكيد على التزامنا الجمعي المشترك للعمل نحو إرساء السلام. كما ناقشنا كيفية إعداد طالبي العلم للاستعداد بشكل أفضل لمواجهة تحديات عالمنا المتغيرة، وكيفية حماية تراثنا الثقافي بشكل مستدام، وضمان أن تسهم المعرفة و التكنولوجيا في خدمة الجميع دون استثناء٠أغادر فيتنام وأنا مفعم بالطاقة نحو العمل على بلورة كافة الأفكارالتي تم مناقشتها، ومتأثر وممتن لحفاوة الاستقبال الذي حظيت به. لقد عززت هذه الزيارة قناعتي بضرورة وجود اليونسكو التي تصغي أكثر، وتنسج روابط أقوى، وتعمل بفعالية لبناء سلام مستدام، عبر أدوات التعليم والعلم والثقافة والاتصال٠",2025-04-25 11:46:57,188,9,1,education

And the pattern continues: while 1 in 3 male graduates of technical colleges (HTL) go on to pursue a STEM degree, only 15% of female graduates do the same.Despite years of effort, the gender gap in STEM remains wide — not because girls lack talent or ambition, but because the system still doesn’t fully support them.The IHS study reveals a sobering reality: Girls in Austria are significantly less likely to complete a STEM education, less likely to enter a STEM profession — and more likely to leave it early. Why?Because of persistent stereotypes.Because of a lack of visible role models.Because of work cultures that don’t yet support part-time roles or family life.That’s why initiatives like Daughters’ Day are so important. When girls feel seen, encouraged, and welcomed into spaces they might never have imagined for themselves — real change begins.🌟 Let’s keep supporting programs that don’t just introduce girls to technology, but help reimagine what a future in STEM can look like: inclusive, creative, and full of opportunity.Kudos to our Austrian colleagues for creating safe spaces where girls can explore their potential!hashtag#GirlsDay hashtag#Töchtertag hashtag#STEM hashtag#Diversity hashtag#Inclusion hashtag#WomenInSTEM hashtag#SiemensHealthineers",2025-04-25 10:46:57,61,2,0,education

The Kent Joint Strategic Needs Assessment also stated that the most affordable area was Dover and that just under 20% of households lived in the private rented sector in 2021, which demonstrates that there is strong rental demand, with a lack of affordable housing. With lower costs, Dover, which is where I concentrate my efforts, offers a better return on my investment.Looking at the eastern coastal towns in Kent, almost all have experienced significant uplifts in house prices.  This has been less marked in Dover, which, logic says, will catch up at some stage, making buying for the longer term a very attractive prospect.If you know anyone who would like to share in the investment potential in Dover, please get them to DM me or click the link in the comment below to visit my website and obtain a copy of my investment guide.hashtag#PropertyInvestment hashtag#Dover hashtag#KentProperty hashtag#RealEstate hashtag#BuyToLet hashtag#RentalDemand hashtag#HousingMarket hashtag#AffordableHousing hashtag#InvestmentOpportunities hashtag#PropertyInvestor hashtag#UKHousing hashtag#RealEstateInvesting hashtag#PassiveIncome hashtag#WealthBuilding",2025-04-25 12:58:57,10,11,0,education
